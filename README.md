# SpreadJS
A single-page web framework by WideSpread. Includes: templating engine, DOM manipulation, pre-built CSS framework, 3D/VR/AR framework, built-in ORM &amp; ODM, MQTT framework, built-in security, and a Socket &amp; RTC framework. Mix and match anything and everything you need for a seamless application that allows developers to make use of anything connected to the internet. SpreadJS can accomodate most hardware for IoT/IIoT, but for the best user experience WideSpread hardware works best (it was built with SpreadJS in mind). ATTENTION: SpreadJS IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION. PLEASE DO NOT TRY AND IMPLEMENT/INTEGRATE IT INTO YOUR APPLICATION AT THIS TIME.
